# Platformer Game Rules

## Coding Style
- Use vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks unless I explicitly ask
- Use HTML Canvas for game rendering
- Use Web Audio API for procedural sounds — no audio files
- Keep all game logic in a single file for simplicity
- Use clear section comments (e.g., `// ---- PLAYER ----`)

## Communication
- I'm a beginner — explain things simply and step by step
- Add features incrementally, one batch at a time
- Show me what's new after each batch with a summary table

## Git & Deployment
- Keep commit messages short and descriptive
- Deploy to GitHub Pages when asked
- Don't push after committing

## Testing
- Use http-server on port 8080 for local testing

## Design
- Make games visually polished with particle effects and animations
- Use rich color palettes, not plain colors
- Add sound effects for every player action

## Progress
- [x] Batch 1: Double jump, wall jump, wall slide, checkpoints, levels 4-5
- [x] Batch 2: Flying bats, spikes, lava hazards
- [ ] Batch 3: Power-ups (speed boost, invincibility, coin magnet)
- [ ] Batch 4: More levels using all mechanics
- [ ] Batch 5: Level select screen, high scores, mobile controls
